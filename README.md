## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop the user interface (UI) of a health and fitness app. The application is designed to provide users with a smooth and intuitive experience, incorporating principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This includes user research, persona creation, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. Our aim is to create a visually appealing and useful app that helps users achieve their fitness goals.

## Projects Included

1. **Fitness Tracking App:** An interactive app that allows users to set fitness goals, track workouts, and visualize their progress.

2. **Meditation and Mindfulness Platform:** A calming platform with guided meditation sessions and stress-relief techniques.

3. **Diet Planning:** An application that assists users in creating personalized meal plans and exploring healthy recipes.

4. **Social Sharing:** A social media-like platform within the app for users to interact with friends and trainers, share content, and more.

## Key Features

- **Activity Tracking:** Users can monitor their daily physical activity, including steps, distance, and calories burned, using their smartphones or wearable devices.

- **Meditation:** Guided meditation sessions to help users relax, focus, and manage stress.

- **Progress Report:** Track weight, body measurements, and workout history to assess fitness progress over time.

- **Workout Scheduling:** Customizable workout plans with exercise steps, explanations, videos, progress tracking, and scheduling.

- **Yoga:** Choose from a variety of yoga positions based on fitness levels and preferences.

- **Nearby Fitness Centers:** Find nearby yoga classes, gyms, and fitness clubs, including class schedules, trainer information, and more.

- **Exercise Suggester:** Get equipment suggestions (dumbbell, skipping rope, exercise mat, exercise ball, resistance band) with brief information based on user preferences.
